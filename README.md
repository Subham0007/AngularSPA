# AngularSPA
Demo project for angular SPA pratice
#html pages(total 5)
1. index.html is my landing page.
2. i made another 3 pages that will be reused for routing purpose.
3. "/" in the index.js shows the default home page of my SPA, which is Home.html.
4. Then we can route to another 2 pages called VALIDATION-FORM.html and about.html .
5. In VALIDATION-FORM.html we can store data to our browser local storage, you can check that.
6. in about.html the is 1 paragraph about the school.
#.js page(1 page)
7. i used app.config for the purpose of routing to different pages.
8. then i used app.controller for the validation and storage of inputs from VALIDATION-FORM.html . 

fix:-
1. Updated the UI a little bit.
2. fixed an issue related to localstorage in browser.
-->previously the latest value inserted in the form was overriding the current stored data,
now its fixed....you can see individual form insert data.
